# Flavor Tale Server

This is the backend server for [Flavor Tale](https://flavor-tale.web.app/), a food ordering and management platform that allows users to explore, add, and purchase various food items. The server is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, with JWT-based authentication and cookie handling for secure access.

---

## Features

### 1. **Authentication**
- **JWT-based authentication** with cookies for secure login and session management.
- Routes for user login (`/jwt`) and logout (`/logout`).

### 2. **Food Management**
- **Get all food items** with optional search (`/foods`).
- **Add new food items** (`POST /foods`).
- **Get food items by user email** (`/foods/email` - protected route).
- **Get single food item by ID** (`/foods/:id`).
- **Update food items** by ID (`PUT /foods/:id`).

### 3. **Purchase Management**
- **Create new purchases** (`POST /purchases`).
- **Fetch all purchases by email** (`/purchases/email` - protected route).
- **Delete a purchase** by ID (`DELETE /purchases/:id`).

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing food items and purchases.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure user authentication.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables.
- **cors**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **cookie-parser**: For parsing cookies.

## Middleware

### 1. **CORS Configuration**
CORS is enabled to allow requests from multiple origins, including:
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `https://flavor-tale.netlify.app`
- `https://flavor-tales.web.app`
- `https://flavor-tales.firebaseapp.com`

### 2. **JWT Verification**
The middleware `verifyToken` is used to protect certain routes by ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.
